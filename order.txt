Order to complete:
1) backend  including -- mongodb connection 
2) frontend

Resolve:

1)when im having a quiz(that means my college has set a quiz ex:mvgr)  it is automatically redirected to exam page where as it should redirect to /main page.
2)when im submitting quiz it is getting 401 error (in the background it is checking for authentication which i guess is no working properly).
3) when im logging with multiple accounts in the same browser and when i click on back button , it is redirecting to previous user data.
ex: i logged in as haneesh@gmail.com and then aftersome i go back to login page and login as kamal@gmail.com now when i click back it is going to haneesh@gmail.com


the first two worked fine without authentication just to have an idea take a fresh clone and checkout to my last commit and try to run just for refernce.
