Order to complete:
1) backend  including -- mongodb connection 
2) frontend


==> in frontend/src/components

i will do landing page,loginform,registration form along with routing

u do home page(i have done half),quizzes (mentioned in the design) and auth(response.token). (try to add google auth if possible or we can do that end of this proj)

when i say auth what i mean is when a user directly types localhost:5000/addQuiz or localhost:5000/main he should not be allowed directly.
